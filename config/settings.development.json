      "ingredients": [
        "2 1/2 pounds chicken legs (about 10 legs)",
        "3/4 cup honey",
        "1/2 cup soy sauce",
        "1/4 cup ketchup",
        "2–3 cloves garlic, minced (or 1 heaping teaspoon of preminced garlic)"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the chicken legs out in a foil-lined baking dish with high sides (the foil is to make clean up easier — it’s not essential but helps a whole lot). A high-sided sheet pan is the best option because it has sides to keep everything in, but it is big enough that the chicken isn’t drowning in the sauce. It will caramelize best if half of the chicken is poking out of the sauce while cooking.",
        "2. In a glass measuring cup, measure out the honey, soy sauce, and ketchup. Add the minced garlic, and stir. If the mixture doesn’t combine well, microwave it on high for 30 seconds and stir again. Pour the honey mixture over the chicken legs.",
        "3. Put the chicken legs in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Take the chicken out of the oven, and rotate it so that the bottom that was in the sauce is now on top, out of the sauce.",
        "4. Put the legs back in the oven. Raise the heat to 425 degrees F., and bake until the sauce is bubbly and starts to caramelize on the chicken legs. This should take about 15 minutes.",
        "5. Remove the chicken from the oven, and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve the sauce the the chicken cooked in with the meal or over rice if you’d like."

        "1 teaspoon salt",

        "6 tablespoons (85g) butter, at room temperature*",

        "5. Drizzle the smaller amount of milk evenly over the flour mixture. Mix quickly and gently for about 15 seconds, until you've made a cohesive dough. If the mixture seems dry and won't come together, don't keep working it; drizzle in enough milk — up to an additional 2 tablespoons (28g) to make it cohesive.",
        "6. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Pat it into a rough rectangle about 3/4\" thick. Fold it into thirds like a letter and roll gently with a floured rolling pin until the dough is 3/4\" thick again.",
        "7.Cut the dough into circles with a biscuit cutter for traditional round biscuits; a 2 3/8\" cutter makes nice-sized biscuits. Or to avoid leftover dough scraps, cut the dough into squares or diamonds with a bench knife or sharp knife.",
        "8. Place the biscuits bottom side up on your prepared baking sheet; turning them over like this yields biscuits with nice, smooth tops. Brush the biscuits with milk, to enhance browning.",
        "9. Bake the biscuits for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're lightly browned. Remove them from the oven, and serve warm."

While dutch oven is heating up, transfer dough to a floured surface, it will be bubbly and sticky.
